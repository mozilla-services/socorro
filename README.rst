Socorro
=======

Socorro is a Mozilla-centric set of services for collecting, processing, and
displaying crash reports from clients using the `Breakpad libraries
<http://code.google.com/p/google-breakpad/>`_.


Support
=======

This is a very Mozilla-specific product. We do not currently have the capacity
to support external users.

If you are looking to use Socorro for your product, maybe you want to consider
alternatives:

* run your own: `electron/mini-breakpad-server <https://github.com/electron/mini-breakpad-server>`_
* run your own: `wk8/sentry_breakpad <https://github.com/wk8/sentry_breakpad>`_
* hosted/on-premise: `Backtrace <https://backtrace.io/>`_


May 3rd, 2017 Update
--------------------

For the last year or so, we've been removing code and making changes that aren't
backwards compatible. A couple of weeks ago, we (Mozilla) extracted the
collector out of Socorro into a separate repository. Because of that, we're
going to start removing code.

If you rely on that collector, the last good release is `270
<https://github.com/mozilla/socorro/releases/tag/270>`_.

You can get it with something like this::

    git clone https://github.com/mozilla/socorro
    git checkout 270


 Or get the tarball::

    wget https://github.com/mozilla/socorro/archive/270.tar.gz
