This thirdparty directory should only be used for libraries which we
cannot deploy and manage automatically. Another valid reason is machine

When a library is not longer released in a craptastic manner, we
should remove it from here and make it a deployment dependency.

I'm looking at you Apache Incubation Thrift version 0.1
