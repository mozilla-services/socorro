    <p>You're seeing this page because the crash report you selected was held back from submission. For statistical purposes, we don't need every crash report and sometimes we decline the submission of a crash report as a form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throttling_process_%28computing%29">throttling</a>. If you'd like to see your crash report, type about:crashes into your location bar and your report will be automatically submitted to our server where we'll give it priority processing.</p>

    <p>Thank you for reporting your crashes.</p>
