Bixie Reporter
==============

This is a reporting webapp for Bixie, a subset of Socorro tinted to support JavaScript errors.

## Getting Started

Create a new virtual environment, activate it, and run `pip install -r requirements/dev.txt`. Then `cp bixie/settings/local.py-dist bixie/settings/local.py`. You may want to edit that new file.
