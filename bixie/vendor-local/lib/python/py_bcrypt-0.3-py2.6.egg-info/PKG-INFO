Description: py-bcrypt is an implementation the OpenBSD Blowfish password hashing
        algorithm, as described in "A Future-Adaptable Password Scheme" by 
        Niels Provos and David Mazieres.
        
        This system hashes passwords using a version of Bruce Schneier's
        Blowfish block cipher with modifications designed to raise the cost
        of off-line password cracking. The computation cost of the algorithm 
        is parametised, so it can be increased as computers get faster.
