No longer collecting Email data (2021-02-11)
============================================

*February 11th, 2021*

As of February 11th, 2021, Socorro is no longer collecting Email data. Email
data in crash reports collected on and after February 11th, 2021 will have the
Email data stripped from the crash report before being saved and processed.

One consequence of this is that new crash reports will no longer show up in
Your Profile.
