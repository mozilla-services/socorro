# Socorro

A server for collecting, processing, and displaying crash reports from
clients using the [Breakpad libraries](http://code.google.com/p/google-breakpad/)

## Support

This is a very Mozilla-specific product. We do not currently have the capacity
to support external users. If you are looking to use Socorro for your product,
maybe you want to consider alternatives like
[electron/mini-breakpad-server](https://github.com/electron/mini-breakpad-server)?
