    <h1 id="policy">Access to memory dumps</h1>
    <p>
      Crash reports include memory dumps which contain sensitive information
      and is not publicly available on Crash Stats. Memory dumps are important
      for diagnosing and debugging issues. As such, users can request access
      to memory dumps in order to debug issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyone with access to memory dumps and private data agrees to the following:
    </p>
    <pre>* Crash dumps contain memory contents, and may contain private user data
* Only access dumps as necessary
* Keep data securely on Mozilla hardware
* When finished with a dump, delete it (within 30 days)
* Do not share personal data from the dump publicly (on bugzilla, irc, etc)
* Do not share personal data with non-employees, including partner organizations, without
  consultation and explicit permission from Lonnen (lonnen@mozilla.com); a signed NDA and
  other arrangements will be required of the other organization
* It is fine to share stack traces, analysis, and other non-personal data
* Access is conditional on employment and will be revoked upon departure from Mozilla
* Access will be removed after a year of inactivity
