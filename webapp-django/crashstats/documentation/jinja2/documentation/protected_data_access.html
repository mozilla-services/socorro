    <h1 id="definition">Protected data on Crash Stats</h1>
    <p>
      Crash reports include memory dumps which contain sensitive information
      and is not publicly available on Crash Stats. Memory dumps are important
      for diagnosing and debugging issues. Further, crash reports may also
      contain private user data such as the user's email address and comments
      if they provided any.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to view protected data, you must be signed in and have been
      granted access to that data.
    </p>

    <h1 id="policy">Access to protected data</h1>
    <p>
      Anyone with access to protected data agrees to the following:
    </p>
    <pre>* Crash dumps contain memory contents and may contain private user data
* Only access protected data and dumps as necessary
* Keep protected data securely on Mozilla hardware
* When finished with a memory dump, delete it (within 30 days)
* Do not share protected data from the dump publicly (on bugzilla, irc, etc)
* Do not share protected data with non-employees, including partner organizations; any
  requests to review exceptions to this policy can be brought up with Trust and Security
* It is fine to share stack traces, analysis, and other non-protected data
* Access is conditional on employment and will be revoked upon departure from Mozilla
* Access will be removed after a year of inactivity
