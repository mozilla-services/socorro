                You're seeing this page because the crash report you selected 
                was held back from submission. For statistical purposes,
                we don't need every crash report and sometimes we decline
                the submission of a crash report as a form of
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throttling_process_%28computing%29">throttling</a>.
                If you'd like to see your crash report, type
                <code>about:crashes</code> into your location bar and
                your report will be automatically submitted to our server where
                we'll give it priority processing.
            </p>

            <p>Thank you for reporting your crashes.</p>
