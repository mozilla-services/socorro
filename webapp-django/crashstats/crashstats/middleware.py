    Middleware that sets REMOTE_ADDR based on HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR, if the
    latter is set. This is useful if you're sitting behind a reverse proxy that
    causes each request's REMOTE_ADDR to be set to 127.0.0.1.

    Note that this does NOT validate HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR. If you're not behind
    a reverse proxy that sets HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR automatically, do not use
    this middleware. Anybody can spoof the value of HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR, and
    because this sets REMOTE_ADDR based on HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR, that means
    anybody can "fake" their IP address. Only use this when you can absolutely
    trust the value of HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR.
