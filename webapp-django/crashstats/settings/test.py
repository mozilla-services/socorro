"""
When you run tests with `./manage.py test` these settings are ALWAYS
imported last and overrides any other base or environment variable
settings.

The purpose of this is to guarantee that certain settings are always
set for test suite runs no matter what you do on the local system.

Ultimately, it helps make sure you never actually use real URLs. For
example, if a test incorrectly doesn't mock `requests.get()` for
example, it shouldn't actually try to reach out to a real valid URL.
