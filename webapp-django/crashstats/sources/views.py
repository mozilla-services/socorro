    Some stack frames are functions that are generated during the build process. Thus the stack
    frame itself isn't particularly helpful since the generated source file isn't available
    anywhere.

    Bug 1389217 and friends adjust the build process to capture the generated source and push it to
    S3.

    This view takes a URL for the generated source, retrieves it from S3, runs it through syntax
    highlighting, and returns that as an HTML page.

    NOTE(willkg): The output of pygments has CSS in the page, but no JS.
