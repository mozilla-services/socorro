          You're seeing this page because the crash report you selected
          was held back from submission. For statistical purposes,
          we don't need every crash report and sometimes we decline
          the submission of a crash report as a form of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throttling_process_%28computing%29">throttling</a>.
          If you'd like to see your crash report, type
          <code>about:crashes</code> into your location bar and
          your report will be automatically submitted to our server where
          we'll give it priority processing.
        </p>

        <p>Thank you for reporting your crashes.</p>
