Signatures Utilities Lists
==========================

This folder contains lists that are used to configure the C signature generation
process. Each ``.txt`` file contains a list of signatures or regex matching
signatures, that are used at various steps of our algorithm. Regular expressions
use the `Python syntax
<https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax>`_.


Signature Generation Algorithm
------------------------------

When generating a C signature, 5 steps are involved.

1. We walk the crashing thread's stack, looking for things that would match the
   `Signature Sentinels <#signature-sentinels>`_. The first matching element, if
   any, becomes the top of the sub-stack we'll consider going forward.
2. We walk the stack, ignoring everything that matches the `Irrelevant
   Signatures <#irrelevant-signatures>`_. We consider the first non-matching
   element the top of the new sub-stack.
3. We rewrite every signature missing symbols that matches the `Trim DLL
   Signatures <#trim-dll-signatures>`_ to be the module only (the part before
   the first ``@`` sign). We also merge them so only one of those frames makes
   it to the final signature.
4. We accumulate signatures that match the `Prefix Signatures
   <#prefix-signatures>`_, until something doesn't match.
5. We normalize each signature we accumulated. Signatures that match the
   `Signatures With Line Numbers <#signatures-with-line-numbers>`_ have their
   associated code line number added to them, like this: ``signature:42``.

The generated signature is a concatenation of all the accumulated signatures,
separated with a pipe sign (``|``).


Signature Sentinels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

File: ``signature_sentinels.txt``

Signature Sentinels are signatures (not regular expression) that should be used
as the top of the stack if present. Everything before the first matching
signature will be ignored.

The code iterates through the stack frame, throwing away everything it finds
until it encounters a match to this regular expression or the end of the stack.
If it finds a match, it passes all the frames after the match to the next step.
If it finds no match, it passes the whole list of frames to the next step.

A typical line might be ``_purecall``.


Irrelevant Signatures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

File: ``irrelevant_signature_re.txt``

Irrelevant Signatures are regular expressions of signatures that will be ignored
while going through the stack. Anything that matches this list will not be added
to the overall signature.

A typical rule might be ``(Nt|Zw)?WaitForSingleObject(Ex)?``.


Prefix Signatures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

File: ``prefix_signature_re.txt``

Prefix Signatures are regular expressions of signatures that will be combined
with the following frame's signature. Signature generation stops at the first
non-matching signature it finds.

A typical rule might be ``JSAutoCompartment::JSAutoCompartment.*``.

Note: These are regular expressions. Dollar signs and other regexp characters
need to be escaped with a ``\``.


Trim DLL Signatures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

File: ``trim_dll_signature_re.txt``

Trim DLL Signatures are regular expressions of signatures that will be trimmed
down to only their module name. For example, if the list contains
``foo32\.dll.*`` and a stack trace looks like this:

.. raw:: html

   <pre>0x0
   foo32.dll@0x2131
   foo32.dll@0x1943
   myFavoriteSig()
   </pre>

The generated signature will be: ``0x0 | foo32.dll | myFavoriteSig()``.


Signatures With Line Numbers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

File: ``signatures_with_line_numbers_re.txt``

Signatures with line number are regular expressions of signatures that will be
combined with their associated source code line numbers.


How to edit these lists
-----------------------

The first thing we will ask you to do is to file a bug. We keep track of every
change in Socorro via bugs, so it's important that each commit has one
associated to it. File a bug in the `Socorro::General component
<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Socorro&component=General>`__,
describe the changes you want to make, and assign it to you.

Then proceed to making those changes...


Using the command line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are a git power user, you probably don't need us to explain how to do
this! :)

If you are not, you're probably better off using GitHub's interface. Read on!


Using GitHub's interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, you need to be logged in to GitHub. Open the file you want to edit, and
then click the little pen in the top right corner of the page, the one that says
*Fork this project and edit the file*, or *Edit the file in your fork of this
project* if you already have a fork of it.

That will take you to an editor, where you can write any changes you want. Once
you are done editting the file, enter a commit description. We have some
conventions, and a bot that will automatically close bugs, so please make your
commit message following this pattern: *Fixes bug XYZ - Desciption of the
change*. Once you are ready, click *Propose file change*.

That will create a branch in your fork of the socorro project, and take you to
the commit you just created. You can verify that the changes you made are
correct, and then click *Create pull request*, and then *Create pull request*
again. Once the pull request is opened, `Travis CI
<https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/socorro>`_ will automatically start running our
test suite, which includes sanity checks for those signature lists. You can see
the status of those tests in the pull request, and click the *Details* link to
see logs in case of a failure.

That's it! You have proposed a change, we have been notified about it. Someone
from the Socorro team will review your changes and merge them if they are
appropriate. Thank you for contributing to Socorro!


Watching only the siglists folder
---------------------------------

If you are interested in watching what's changing in the ``siglists`` directory
in the repository, but don't care much about what happens in the rest of the
Socorro repo, you can easily set a filter in your email client to do that.
Here's an example filter you can use today:

.. raw:: html

   <pre>to:(socorro@noreply.github.com) ("A socorro/siglists/" OR "M socorro/siglists/" OR "D socorro/siglists")</pre>
