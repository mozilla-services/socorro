          Memory used by the system allocator that is currently allocated to

          uses for most or all of its heap allocations. Ideally this number is
          zero, but on some platforms we cannot force every heap allocation
          through jemalloc.

          much better measure of the memory resources used by the process.

      status of objects which were blocking completion of the shutdown when
      reaching the timeout is contained in the annotation.

      In the case of IndexedDB, objects are divided into three groups:
      FactoryOperations, LiveDatabases and DatabaseMaintenances.

      In the case of LocalStorage, objects are divided into three groups:
      PrepareDatastoreOperations, Datastores and LiveDatabases.

      In the case of Cache API, objects are in one group only:
      Managers.

      Each group is reported separately and contains the number of objects in
      the group and the status of individual objects in the group (duplicate
      entries are removed): "GroupName: N (objectStatus1, objectStatus2, ...)"
      where N is the number of objects in the group.

      The status of individual objects is constructed by taking selected object
      properties. Properties which contain origin strings are anonymized.

      In addition, intermediate steps are recorded for change events after
      shutdown started. These include the time difference and the type of

      If Firefox crashes while some code is spinning manually the event loop on
      the main thread, this will be the stack of nested annotations.

      If the crashing process was killed (e.g. due to an IPC error), this
      annotation may refer to the parent process that killed it, look out for
      the prefix (`default` means parent) and see bug 1741131 for details.
