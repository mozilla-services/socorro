    """Crash queue that uses AWS SQS.

    This requires three AWS SQS queues:

    * **standard queue**: processing incoming crashes from the collector
    * **priority queue**: processing crashes right now because someone/something
      is trying to view them
    * **reprocessing queue**: reprocessing crashes after a change to the processor
      that have (probably) already been processed

    When configuring credentials for this crashqueue object, you can do one of two
    things:

    1. provide ``ACCESS_KEY`` and ``SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`` in the configuration, OR
    2. use one of the other methods described in the boto3 docs
       http://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/configuration.html#configuring-credentials

    You also need to have three AWS SQS queues:

    * standard
    * priority
    * reprocessing

    and they need the following settings:

    ==========================  =========
    Setting                     Value
    ==========================  =========
    Default Visibility Timeout  5 minutes
    Message Retention Period    *default*
    Maximum Message Size        *default*
    Delivery Delay              *default*
    Receive Message Wait Time   *default*
    ==========================  =========

    The AWS credentials that Socorro is configured with must have the following
    Amazon SQS permissions on the SQS queue you created:

    * ``sqs:GetQueueUrl``

      Socorro needs to convert a queue name to a queue url. This requires the
      ``sqs:GetQueueUrl``

    * ``sqs:SendMessage``

      Socorro sends messages to a queue--this is how the webapp publishes crash ids
      to the priority and reprocessing queues. This requires the ``sqs:SendMessage``
      permission.

    * ``sqs:DeleteMessage``

      Once Socorro processor has processed a crash report, it needs to delete the
      message from the queue. This requires the ``sqs:DeleteMessage`` permission.

    * ``sqs:ReceiveMessage``

      The Socorro processor has to receive messages from the queue in order to
      process the related crash reports. This requires teh ``sqs:ReceiveMessage``
      permission.

    If something isn't configured correctly, then the Socorro processor will be unable
    to process crashes and the webapp will be unable to publish crash ids for
    processing.
