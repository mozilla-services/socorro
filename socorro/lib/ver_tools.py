"""A function and supporting structure to turn Mozilla version strings into
a sortable normalized format.

Pubic Functions:

normalize - given a version in a string, this function returns a list of
            normalized version parts of the abcd format outlined in
            https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Toolkit_version_format
            Two lists are comparable using standard relational operators:
            <,>,!=,==, etc.
