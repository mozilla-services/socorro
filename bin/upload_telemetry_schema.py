    We always send a copy of the crash (mainly processed crash) to a S3 bucket
    meant for Telemetry to ingest. When they ingest, they need a copy of our
    telemetry_socorro_crash.json JSON Schema file.

    They use that not to understand the JSON we store but the underlying
    structure (types, nesting etc.) necessary for storing it in .parquet files
    in S3.

    To get a copy of the telemetry_socorro_crash.json they can take it from the git
    repository but that's fragile since it depends on github.com always being available.

    By uploading it to S3 not only do we bet on S3 being more read-reliable
    that github.com's server but by being in S3 AND unavailable that means the
    whole ingestion process has to halt/pause anyway.
