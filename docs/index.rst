Socorro - Crash ingestion pipeline
==================================

Socorro is a set of components for collecting, processing and reporting on
crashes. It is used by Mozilla for tracking crashes of Mozilla products.

Mozilla's crash analysis tool is hosted at
`<https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/>`_.

The components which make up Socorro are:

* Collector - collects breakpad minidump crashes which come in over HTTP POST

  `Antenna <https://antenna.readthedocs.io/>`_ now collects crashes for Socorro.

* Processor - turn breakpad minidump crashes into stack traces and other info
* Web UI for analysis aka crash-stats - Django-based web app for visualizing
  crash data

Socorro is available from source in a git repository at
`<https://github.com/mozilla-services/socorro/>`_.
