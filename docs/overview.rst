Overview
========

The Socorro Crash Reporting system consists of two pieces, the Socorro
Server and the Socorro UI.

Socorro Server
--------------

:ref:`server-chapter` is a Python API and a collection of applications and web
services that use the API. The applications together embody a set of
servers to take crash dumps generated by remote clients, process using
the breakpad_stackdump application and save the results in HBase.
Additional processes aggregate and filter data for storage in a
relational database.

The server consists of these components:

* :ref:`collector-chapter`
* Hadoop/HBase
* :ref:`processor-chapter`
* [[SocorroRegistrar]]
* [[SocorroWebServices]]

Socorro UI
----------

:ref:`ui-chapter` is a Web application to access and analyze the database
contents via search and generated reports.


Data Flow
---------

Crash dumps are accepted by the :ref:`collector-chapter`, a mod_wsgi
application running under Apache. Collector stores the crashes into
HBase.

Using Hadoop jobs, the crash dumps in HBase are converted into
searchable json files using :ref:`processor-chapter`.


The :ref:`processor-chapter` s are also long running applications that live on
Hadoop processing nodes. They accept tasks from map reduce jobs and
employ the stackwalk_server? to convert crashes into json files stored
back into HBase. Filtering through these converted crashes using the
:ref:`throttling-chapter` rules initially applied by the
:ref:`collector-chapter`.

The :ref:`ui-chapter` allows developers to browse the crash information from
the relational database. In addition to being able to examine specific
individual crash reports, there are trend reports that show which
crashes are the most common as well as the status of bugs about those
crashes in Bugzilla.
