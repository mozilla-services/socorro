Database Admin Function Reference
=================================

What follows is a listing of custom functions written for Socorro in the
PostgreSQL database which are intended for database administration,
particularly scheduled tasks.   Many of these functions depend on other,
internal functions which are not documented.

All functions below return BOOLEAN, with TRUE meaning completion, and 
throw an ERROR if they fail, unless otherwise noted.

MatView Functions
=================

These functions manage the population of the many Materialized Views
in Socorro.  In general, for each matview there are two functions
which maintain it:

::

	update_{matview_name} ( DATE )
	
	fills in one day of the matview for the first time
	will error if data is already present, or source data
	is missing
	
	backfill_{matview_name} ( DATE )
	
	deletes one day of data for the matview and recreates
	it.  will warn, but not error, if source data is missing
	safe for use without downtime
	
Exceptions to the above are generally for procedures which need to 
run hourly or more frequently (e.g. update_reports_clean,
reports_duplicates).  Also, some functions have shortcut names where
they don't use the full name of the matview (e.g. update_adu).

Note that the various matviews can take radically different amounts
of time to update or backfill ... from a couple of seconds to 10 
minutes for one day.

In addition, there are several procedures which are designed to
update or backfill multiple matviews for a range of days.  These
are designed for when there has been some kind of widespread issue
in crash processing and a bunch of crashes have been reprocessed
and need to be re-aggregated.  

These mass-backfill functions generally give a lot of command-line
feedback on their progress, and should be run in a screen session,
as they may take hours to complete.  These functions, as the most
generally used, are listed first. If you are doing a mass-backfill, 
you probably want to limit
the backfill to a week at a time in order to prevent it from running
too long before committing.


backfill_matviews
-----------------

Purpose: backfills data for all matviews for a specific range of dates.
For use when data is either missing or needs to be retroactively 
corrected.

Called By: manually by admin as needed

::

  backfill_matviews (
    startdate DATE,
    optional enddate DATE default current_date,
    optional reportsclean BOOLEAN default true 
  )

  SELECT backfill_matviews( '2011-11-01', '2011-11-27', false );
  SELECT backfill_matviews( '2011-11-01' );

startdate
  the first date to backfill
  
enddate
  the last date to backfill.  defaults to the current UTC date.
  
reportsclean
  whether or not to backfill reports_clean as well.  
  defaults to true
  supplied because the backfill of reports_clean takes
  a lot of time.
  	
  
backfill_reports_clean
----------------------

Purpose: backfill only the reports_clean normalized fact table. 

Called By: admin as needed

::

	backfill_reports_clean (
		starttime TIMESTAMPTZ,
		endtime TIMESTAMPTZ,
	)
	
	SELECT backfill_reports_clean ( '2011-11-17', '2011-11-29 14:00:00' );
	
starttime 
	timestamp to start backfill
	
endtime 
	timestamp to halt backfill at
	
Note: if backfilling less than 1 day, will backfill in 1-hour increments.  If backfilling more than one day, will backfill in 6-hour increments.  Can take a long time to backfill more than a couple of days.
   
  
update_adu, backfill_adu
------------------------

Purpose: updates or backfills one day of the product_adu table, which
is one of the two matviews powering the graphs in socorro.  Note that
if ADU is out of date, it has no dependancies, so you only need to run
this function.

Called By: update function called by the update_matviews cron job. 

::

	update_adu ( 
		updateday DATE 
		);
		
	backfill_adu (
		updateday DATE
		);
		
	SELECT update_adu('2011-11-26');

	SELECT backfill_adu('2011-11-26');
	
updateday
	DATE of the UTC crash report day to update or backfill
	
	
update_products
---------------

Purpose: updates the list of product_versions and product_version_builds 
based on the contents of releases_raw.

Called By: daily cron job

::

	update_products (
		)
		
	SELECT update_products ( '2011-12-04' );
	
Notes: takes no parameters as the product update is always cumulative.  As of 2.3.5, only looks at product_versions with build dates in the last 30 days.  There is no backfill function because it is always a cumulative update.


update_tcbs, backfill_tcbs
--------------------------

Purpose: updates "tcbs" based on the contents of the report_clean table

Called By: daily cron job

::

	update_tcbs (
		updateday DATE,
		checkdata BOOLEAN optional default true
		)
		
	SELECT update_tcbs ( '2011-11-26' );
	
	backfill_tcbs (
		updateday DATE
		)
		
	SELECT backfill_tcbs ( '2011-11-26' );
	
updateday
	UTC day to pull data for.
checkdata
	whether or not to check dependant data and throw an error if it's not found.
	
Notes: updates only "new"-style versions.  Until 2.4, update_tcbs pulled data directly from reports and not reports_clean.  


update_daily_crashes, backfill_daily_crashes
--------------------------------------------

Purpose: updates "daily_crashes" based on the contents of the report_clean table

Called By: daily cron job

::

	update_daily_crashes (
		updateday DATE,
		checkdata BOOLEAN optional default true
		)
		
	SELECT update_daily_crashes ( '2011-11-26' );
	
	backfill_daily_crashes (
		updateday DATE
		)
		
	SELECT backfill_daily_crashes ( '2011-11-26' );
	
updateday
	UTC day to pull data for.
checkdata
	whether or not to check dependant data and throw an error if it's not found.
	
Notes: updates only "new"-style versions.  Until 2.4, update_daily_crashes pulled data directly from reports and not reports_clean.  Probably the slowest of the regular update functions; can date up to 4 minutes to do one day.

update_rank_compare, backfill_rank_compare
------------------------------------------

Purpose: updates "rank_compare" based on the contents of the reports_clean table

Called By: daily cron job

::

	update_rank_compare (
		updateday DATE optional default yesterday,
		checkdata BOOLEAN optional default true
		)
		
	SELECT update_rank_compare ( '2011-11-26' );
	
	backfill_rank_compare (
		updateday DATE optional default yesterday
		)
		
	SELECT backfill_rank_compare ( '2011-11-26' );
	
updateday
	UTC day to pull data for.  Optional; defaults to ( CURRENT_DATE - 1 ).
checkdata
	whether or not to check dependant data and throw an error if it's not found.
	
Note: this matview is not historical, but contains only one day of data.  As
such, running either the update or backfill function replaces all existing data.
Since it needs an exclusive lock on the matview, it is possible (though 
unlikely) for it to fail to obtain the lock and error out.

update_nightly_builds, backfill_nightly_builds
----------------------------------------------

Purpose: updates "nightly_builds" based on the contents of the reports_clean table

Called By: daily cron job

::

	update_nightly_builds (
		updateday DATE optional default yesterday,
		checkdata BOOLEAN optional default true
		)
		
	SELECT update_nightly_builds ( '2011-11-26' );
	
	backfill_nightly_builds (
		updateday DATE optional default yesterday
		)
		
	SELECT backfill_nightly_builds ( '2011-11-26' );
	
updateday
	UTC day to pull data for.
checkdata
	whether or not to check dependant data and throw an error if it's not found.  Optional.


Schema Management Functions
===========================

These functions support partitioning, upgrades, and other management
of tables and views.

weekly_report_partitions
------------------------

Purpose: to create new paritions for the reports table and its  child
tables every week.

Called By: weekly cron job

::

	weekly_report_partitions ( 
		optional numweeks integer default 2,
		optional targetdate date default current_date
	)
	
	SELECT weekly_report_partitions();
	SELECT weekly_report_partitions(3,'2011-11-09');

numweeks
	number of weeks ahead to create partitions
targetdate
	date for the starting week, if not today
	
	
try_lock_table
--------------

Purpose: attempt to get a lock on a table, looping with sleeps until
the lock is obtained.

Called by: various functions internally

::

	try_lock_table (
		tabname TEXT,
		mode TEXT optional default 'EXCLUSIVE',
		attempts INT optional default 20
	) returns BOOLEAN
	
	IF NOT try_lock_table('rank_compare', 'ACCESS EXCLUSIVE') THEN
		RAISE EXCEPTION 'unable to lock the rank_compare table for update.';
	END IF;
	
tabname 
	the table name to lock
mode
	the lock mode per PostgreSQL docs.  Defaults to 'EXCLUSIVE'.
attempts
	the number of attempts to make, with 3 second sleeps between each.
	optional, defaults to 20.

Returns TRUE for table locked, FALSE for unable to lock.


create_table_if_not_exists
--------------------------

Purpose: creates a new table, skipping if the table is found to already
exist.

Called By: upgrade scripts

::

	create_table_if_not_exists (
		tablename TEXT,
		declaration TEXT,
		tableowner TEXT optional default 'breakpad_rw',
		indexes TEXT ARRAY default empty list
	)
	
	SELECT create_table_if_not_exists ( 'rank_compare', $q$
		create table rank_compare (
			product_version_id int not null,
			signature_id int not null,
			rank_days int not null,
			report_count int,
			total_reports bigint,
			rank_report_count int,
			percent_of_total numeric,
			constraint rank_compare_key primary key ( product_version_id, signature_id, rank_days )
		);$q$, 'breakpad_rw', 
		ARRAY [ 'product_version_id,rank_report_count', 'signature_id' ]);
	
tablename
	name of the new table to create
declaration
	full CREATE TABLE sql statement, plus whatever other SQL statements you
	only want to run on table creation such as priming it with a few 
	records and creating the primary key.  If running more than one 
	SQL statement, separate them with semicolons.
tableowner
	the ROLE which owns the table.  usually 'breakpad_rw'.  optional.
indexes
	an array of sets of columns to create regular btree indexes on.
	use the array declaration as demonstrated above.  default is 
	to create no indexes.
	
Note: this is the best way to create new tables in migration scripts, since
it allows you to rerun the script multiple times without erroring out.
However, be aware that it only checks for the existance of the table, not
its definition, so if you modify the table definition you'll need to 
manually drop and recreate it.
		
Other Administrative Functions
==============================

add_old_release
---------------

Purpose: Allows you to add an old release to productdims/product_visibility.

Called By: on demand by Firefox or Camino teams.

::

	add_old_release (
			product_name text,
			new_version text,
			release_type release_enum default 'major',
			release_date DATE DEFAULT current_date,
			is_featured BOOLEAN default FALSE
	) returns BOOLEAN
	
	SELECT add_old_release ('Camino','2.1.1');
	SELECT add_old_release ('Camino','2.1.2pre','development','2012-03-09',true);
	
Notes: if this leads to more than 4 currently featured versions, the oldest 
featured vesion will be "bumped".
