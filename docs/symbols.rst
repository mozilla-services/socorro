How to pack the symbols archive files
=====================================

The minidump processor uses the binary filename (of the executable or shared
library) along with a debug ID (which is a GUID with one additional character)
to locate symbol files for each module in a minidump. Breakpad symbol files as
produced by the ``dump_syms`` tool contain all the information needed to create
the proper file paths in the first line of the file.

As a concrete example, if you run ``dump_syms`` on a single binary named
``test``:

::

    $ dump_syms ./test > test.sym
    $ head -n1 test.sym
    MODULE Linux x86_64 88886647D0C07CCA8B370069D9DF6F850 test
    $ mkdir -p symbols/test/88886647D0C07CCA8B370069D9DF6F850
    $ mv test.sym symbols/test/88886647D0C07CCA8B370069D9DF6F850
    $ find symbols -type f
    symbols/test/88886647D0C07CCA8B370069D9DF6F850/test.sym
    $ (cd symbols; zip -r9 ../symbols.zip *)
      adding: test/ (stored 0%)
      adding: test/88886647D0C07CCA8B370069D9DF6F850/ (stored 0%)
      adding: test/88886647D0C07CCA8B370069D9DF6F850/test.sym (deflated 71%)
    $ unzip -l symbols.zip
    Archive:  symbols.zip

The filename here is ``test``, and the debug ID is the GUID shown. The contents
of the ``symbols`` directory can be zipped up as shown and will work properly to
symbolicate crash reports.

There are `a simple set of scripts
<https://gist.github.com/luser/2ad32d290f224782fcfc>`_ available for generating
and uploading symbol zip files in the proper format. You may also be interested
in `symbolstore.py
<https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/crashreporter/tools/symbolstore.py>`_,
which is what official Firefox builds use to package their symbols.


How to upload
=============

Go to `Symbols <https://symbols.mozilla.org>`_ for uploading symbols.
