Getting started
===============

This chapter covers getting started with Socorro using Docker for a local
development environment.

If you're interested in running Socorro in a server environment, then check out
:ref:`deploying-socorro-chapter`.


Quickstart
==========

1. Install `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/>`_.

2. Install `docker-compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>`_. You need
   1.10 or higher.

   .. Note::

      It helps to add an alias to your shell::

        alias dc=docker-compose

      because it's way easier to type "dc" and I do it a lot.

3. Install `make <https://www.gnu.org/software/make/>`_ using either your
   system's package manager (Linux) or homebrew (OSX).

   FIXME(willkg): Windows instructions?

4. From the root of this repository, run::

     $ make dockerbuild

   That will build the containers required for development: test, processor, and
   webapp.

5. Then you need to set up Postgres and Elasticssearch. To do that, run::

     $ make dockersetup


   You can run ``make dockersetup`` any time you want to wipe the database, pick
   up changes in static data, stored procedures, types, migrations, etc.

   .. Warning::

      This is a work in progress and might be fussy about some things.

      Pull requests welcome!


At this point, you should have a basic functional Socorro development
environment.

See :ref:`webapp-chapter` for additional setup and running the webapp.

See :ref:`processor-chapter` for additional setup and running the processor.


Updating data in a dev environment
==================================

Wiping the db
-------------

Any time you want to wipe the database and start over, run ``make dockersetup``.


Updating release data
---------------------

Data on releases comes from running ftpscraper. After you run ftpscraper, you
have to run featured-versions-automatic which will update the featured versions
list.

We put all that in a single shell script.

Run::

  $ docker-compose run processor docker/run_update_release_data.sh


.. Warning::

   This can take a long while to run and if you're running it against an
   existing database, then ftpscraper will "catch up" since the last time it ran
   which can take a long time, maybe hours.


General architecture
====================

.. image:: block-diagram.png

Arrows direction represents the flow of interesting information (crashes,
authentication assertions, cached values), not trivia like acks.


Configuration
-------------

All configuration is done with ENV files located in ``/app/docker/config/``.

Each service uses ``docker_common.env`` and then a service-specific ENV file.

``docker_common.env``
    This holds secrets and environment-specific configuration required
    to get services to work in a docker environment for local development.

    This should NOT be used for server environments.

``test.env``
    This holds configuration specific to running the tests. It has some
    configuration value overrides because the tests are "interesting".

``processor.env`` and ``webapp.env``
    These configuration files hold behavioral configuration for these two things
    that work across ALL environments--local development and servers.

    For example, if you want to add a new destination crash store to the system,
    you'd add it to ``processor.env``.


In this way, we have behavioral configuration versioned alongside code changes
and we can more easily push and revert changes.
