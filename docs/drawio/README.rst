Use `diagrams.net <https://diagrams.net>`_.

Download the desktop client at `<https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases>`_.

Make sure to save and load source diagrams in SVG format. This allows us to
grep the repository and find things in the diagrams.

After making changes, commit the SVG to git and double-check the text around
the diagram to make sure it's still correct.
