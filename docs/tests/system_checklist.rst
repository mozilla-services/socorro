Socorro Test Checklist
======================

Last updated: February 16th, 2023

This is a high-level system-wide checklist for making sure Socorro is working
correctly in a specific environment. It's a helpful template for figuring out
what you need to check if you're pushing out a significant change.

.. Note::

   This is used infrequently! If you're about to make a significant change, you
   should go through the checklist to make sure the checklist is correct and
   that everything is working as expected and fix anything that's wrong, THEN
   make your change and go through the checklist again.

Lonnen the bear says, "Only you can prevent production fires!"


How to use
==========

"Significant change" can mean any number of things, so this is just a template.
You should do the following:

1. Copy and paste the contents of this into a Google Doc or whatever system you
   plan to use to keep track of status and outstanding issues.

2. Go through what you copy-and-pasted, remove things that don't make sense,
   and add additional things that are important.

   Please uplift any changes via PR to this document that are interesting.
