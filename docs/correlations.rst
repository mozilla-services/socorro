Correlations
============

The *Signature Report* in the Crash Stats website has a *Correlations* tab.
When you click on that tab, it either shows you correlations for that product
and release channel or it tells you there is no correlations data.

Correlations data is stored in files on another server outside of Socorro.

Correlations data is generated by code located at
`<https://github.com/marco-c/crashcorrelations>`_.

The correlations scripts are run in DataBricks.

Correlations are generated for Firefox using any fields that are in the
``telemetry.socorro_crash`` data set in Telemetry.

Correlations are run on the top 200 signatures.

If you have problems with correlations, please write up an issue in their issue
tracker.

   See :ref:`telemetry-chapter` for adding fields to ``telemetry.socorro_crash``.
