Correlations
============

The *Signature Report* in the Crash Stats website has a *Correlations* tab.
When you click on that tab, it shows you correlations for that product and
release channel if it's available.

Correlations data is generated by code located at
`<https://github.com/marco-c/crashcorrelations>`__ and run in Telemetry Airflow
with the DAG at
`<https://github.com/mozilla/python_mozetl/blob/main/mozetl/symbolication/top_signatures_correlations.py>`__.
The data is stored in files in GCP GCS.

Correlations are generated for Firefox using any fields that are in the
``telemetry.socorro_crash`` data set in Telemetry BigQuery.

Correlations are not maintained by the Socorro engineering team. If you have
problems with correlations, please write up an issue in the crashcorrelations
issue tracker.

   See :ref:`telemetry-chapter` for adding fields to ``telemetry.socorro_crash``.
