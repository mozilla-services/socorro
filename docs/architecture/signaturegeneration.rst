Signature Generation
====================

Introduction
============

During processing of a crash, Socorro creates a signature using the signature
generation module. Signature generation typically starts with a string based
on the stack of the crashing thread. Various rules are applied and after everything
is done, we have a Socorro crash signature.

The signature generation code is here:

The SkipList Rules
==================

The signature is generated by walking through each stack frame considering its
'name' (as normalized above). Frames / names are skipped or added to the
signature list according to the rules. When a signature list is complete, it is
converted to string by concatenating the frame names with spaces and a vertical
bar between each name, for example: objc_msgSend | IdleTimerVector is the
signature for a stack that contained (irrelevant frames), "objc_msgSend",
"IdleTimerVector" which matched neither prefix nor irrelevant regular
expressions and possibly other frames which did not become part of the
signature.
