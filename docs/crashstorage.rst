Crash storage: API and Implementations
======================================

Documentation of our CrashStorage API. This attempts to provide a complete
picture of all the crash storage classes that are provided by Socorro.

Connection contexts are a connection Factory in the form of a Functor that
returns thinly wrapped connections to the resource.

Reasons we have ``connection_context``:

* wrapper for use with ``with``
* pooled connection context - connections held on to, doesn't log out
* to make threading easier to manage

socorro.external.crashstorage_base
==================================

Base class that defines the crash storage API. You implement this when you want
to plug into any of the Socorro backend components.

Base class:

* `CrashStorageBase`: Defines ``save_processed_crash()``, ``get_raw_crash()``,
  etc.

CrashStorage containers for aggregating multiple crash storage implementations:

* `PolyCrashStorage`: Container for other crash storage systems.

Helper for PolyCrashStore:

* `PolyCrashStorageError`: Exception for `PolyCrashStorage`.

How we use these:

We use `CrashStorageBase` in our ``socorro/external`` crash storage
implementations. We use `PolyCrashStorage` (and related containers) as a way to
fork "streams of crashes" into different storage engines. Also, the
`CrashStorage` containers can contain each other!


socorro.external.es: Elasticsearch
==================================

Socorro uses Elasticsearch as a back-end for several search and report features
in the web app:

* **Super Search** allows users to search through any field in the database. It
  exposes powerful operators to build complex queries. It is accessible via the
  public API, allowing users to build their own tools. It is used to implement
  the other search features.
* **Custom Queries** allow users to write JSON queries that are executed
  directly against Elasticsearch. This gives unrestricted access to the data,
  and requires additional permissions.
* **Signature Reports** provide useful information about crashes that share a
  signature. This includes aggregation on any database field, exploring
  crash reports, and generating graphs.

Socorro currently requires Elasticsearch version 1.4.

You can see Elasticsearch common options by passing ``--help`` to the
processor app and looking at the ``resource.elasticsearch`` options like
this::

  $ make shell
  app@socorro:/app$ python ./socorro/processor/processor_app.py \
      --destination.crashstorage_class=socorro.external.es.crashstorage.ESCrashStorage \
      --help


The ``resource.elasticsearch`` portion looks like this::

  --resource.elasticsearch.elasticsearch_class
    (default: socorro.external.es.connection_context.ConnectionContext)

  --resource.elasticsearch.elasticsearch_doctype
    the default doctype to use in elasticsearch
    (default: crash_reports)

  --resource.elasticsearch.elasticsearch_index
    an index format to pull crashes from elasticsearch (use datetime's strftime format to have daily, weekly or monthly indexes)
    (default: socorro%Y%W)

  --resource.elasticsearch.elasticsearch_shards_per_index
    number of shards to set in newly created indices. Elasticsearch default is 5.
    (default: 10)

  --resource.elasticsearch.elasticsearch_timeout
    the time in seconds before a query to elasticsearch fails
    (default: 30)

  --resource.elasticsearch.elasticsearch_timeout_extended
    the time in seconds before a query to elasticsearch fails in restricted sections
    (default: 120)

  --resource.elasticsearch.elasticsearch_urls
    the urls to the elasticsearch instances
    (default: http://elasticsearch:9200)


Validate your configuration
---------------------------

The best way to verify you have correctly configured your application for
Elasticsearch is to send it a crash report and verify it is indexed. Follow the
steps in :ref:`processor-chapter` to process a crash in your system. Once it is
processed, verify that your Elasticsearch instance has the data:

::

    $ curl -XGET localhost:9200/socorroYYYYWW/crash_reports/_count


By default, the indices used by Socorro are ``socorroYYYYWW``, so make sure you
get this part right depending on your configuration and the current date.

If you want to use the Web app the check your data, the best way is to go to the
Super Search page (you need to switch it on) and hit the Search button with no
parameter. That should return all the crash reports that were indexed in the
passed week.


Super Search fields
-------------------

Super Search, and thus all the features based on it, is powered by a list of
fields that tells it what data to expose and how to expose it. That list
contains data about each field from Elasticsearch that can be manipulated.

The list is managed in code in ``socorro/external/es/super_search_fields.py``
as a dict of ``name`` -> ``properties``.

The name of a field is exposed in the Super Search API. This must be unique.

Here is an explanation of each properties of a field:

**name**
    The name of the field.

**description**
    Brief description of the field.

    This shows up in the `Super Search API documentation
    <https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/documentation/supersearch/api/>`_.

**namespace**
    The dotted name space for the source of the value of this field.

    Examples:

    * ``raw_crash``
    * ``processed_crash``
    * ``processed_crash.json_dump.crashing_thread``

**in_database_name**
    This is the name used to store this field value in Elasticsearch and other
    places.

**query_type**
    Specifies the operators that can be used with this field in Super Search.
    See the list of query types below.

**data_validation_type**
    Specifies how values are validated when passed to filters of this field
    in Super Search.

    Possible values: ``str``, ``enum``, ``bool``, ``int``, ``datetime``,

**permissions_needed**
    Permissions needed for a user to access this field.

**form_field_choices**
    Possible values for this field in the Super Search form.

**is_exposed**
    Is this field exposed as a filter or field in Super Search?

    If this is set to ``True``, you must specify a ``storage_mapping``.

**is_returned**
    Is this field returned in Super Search results or the RawCrash/ProcessedCrash
    API?

**has_full_version**
    Does this field have a full version in Elasticsearch? Enable only if you use
    a multitype field in the storage mapping.

**storage_mapping**
    Mapping that is used in Elasticsearch for this field. See below for more
    information.

    If ``storage_mapping`` is set to ``None``, this field will not be indexed
    in Elasticsearch. If it's not indexed, make sure ``is_exposed`` is set to
    ``False``.

    If you want the default ``storage_mapping``, set it to::

        {"type": "string"}


Query types
-----------

Here are the operators that will be available for each ``query_type``. Note that
each operator automatically has an opposite version (for example, each field
that has access to the ``contains`` operator also has ``does not contain``).

+----------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| Query type value     | Operators                                            |
+======================+======================================================+
| enum                 | has terms                                            |
+----------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| string               | contains, is, starts with, ends with, exists         |
+----------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| number               | has terms, >, >=, <, <=                              |
+----------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| date                 | has terms, >, >=, <, <=                              |
+----------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| bool                 | is true                                              |
+----------------------+------------------------------------------------------+


Storage mapping
---------------

The storage mapping field contains Elasticsearch mapping instructions for the
field.

See `Elasticsearch 1.4 mapping documentation
<https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.4/mapping.html>`_.


socorro.external.fs: File system
================================

**socorro.external.fs.crashstorage**

Implements Radix Tree storage of crashes in a filesystem.

Use cases:

* For Mozilla use by the collectors.
* For other users, you can use this class as your primary storage instead of S3.
  Be sure to implement this in collectors, crashmovers, processors and
  middleware (depending on which components you use in your configuration).

.. Note::

   Because of the slowness of deleting directories created by on-disk, non-SSD
   storage, the collectors do not unlink directories over time. For many
   environments, you will need to periodically unlink directories, possibly by
   entirely wiping out partitions, rather than using `find` or some other UNIX
   utility to delete.

Classes:

* `FSPermanentStorage` - Doesn't have a queueing mechanism. Processors can
  use these for local storage that doesn't require any knowledge of queueing.
  Backwards compatible with `socorro.external.filesystem` (aka the 2009 system).


socorro.external.boto: AWS S3
=============================

The collector saves raw crash data to Amazon S3.

The processor loads raw crash data from Amazon S3, processes it, and then saves
the processed crash data back to Amazon S3.

All of this is done in a single S3 bucket.

The "directory" hierarchy of that bucket looks like this:

* ``{prefix}/v2/{name_of_thing}/{entropy}/{date}/{id}``: Raw crash data.
* ``{prefix}/v1/{name_of_thing}/{id}``: Processed crash data, dumps, dump_names,
  and other things.
