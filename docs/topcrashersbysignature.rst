Top Crashers By Signature
=========================

Introduction
============

Topcrashers By Signature compiles the 14 days' worth of crash reports (organized
by signature) for a given version. This report is useful for finding new
topcrashes, determining if topcrashes have been filed, and seeing trending of
topcrashes over time (for a specific version).


Details
=======

For the ideal topcrashers by signature report, we want to gather the following
data:

* crashes by version (e.g., Firefox 3.0.9)
* date a crash occurred (to know if it's within our window)
* stack signature
* average uptime (since last browser start) averaged over window
* bug numbers related to crash signature

Additionally, we need the ability to either a) go back in time or b) "freeze"
the topcrashers by signature report on a specific day. This allows us to
compare, say, the last day of a release to the newest release (e.g., Firefox
3.0.8 to Firefox 3.0.9). Without the ability to go back to a specific day of
topcrash reports or freeze topcrash reports, we have no easy ability to compare
releases (as new crashes come in for old releases, the topcrash list changes
substantially).

**Ideal Outputs**

FIXME: to be filled

See SocorroUIInstallation for additional details.


Operations
==========

* Need a recalculation every 4 to 6 hours
* Need top 500 signatures, ranked over last 14 days
* Note that this implies for the database that each slice is
  aggregated from the full window (which slides forward each time)
