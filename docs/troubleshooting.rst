Login problems

Socorro uses Google to authenticate users.

The "Sign in" button is in the footer of the Crash Stats web interface.

If you are having problems logging in, here are some things to try:

1. Make sure your browser is set to accept third-party cookies.

   Your browser needs to accept third-party cookies during authentication. After
   you've authenticated, you can switch it off again.

2. Disable tracking protection.

   This has helped some people in some cases.


If none of those steps worked, please open up a bug.
