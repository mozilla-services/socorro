This chapter covers getting started with Socorro using Docker for a local
development environment.

.. _setup-quickstart:

Setup quickstart
================

1. Install required software: Docker, just, and git.

   **Linux**:

       git: use package manager

       docker: `install Docker Engine <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/>`__

       just: `just.systems <https://just.systems/man/en/packages.html>`__

   **OSX**:

       docker: Install `Docker for Mac <https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/>`_ which
       will install Docker.

       just and git: Use `homebrew <https://brew.sh>`_.

       .. code-block:: shell

          $ brew install just git

   **Other**:

       docker: Install `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/>`_.

       git: Install `git <https://git-scm.com/>`_.

       just: Install `just <https://github.com/casey/just?tab=readme-ov-file#installation>`_.

2. Clone the repository so you have a copy on your host machine.

   Instructions for cloning are `on the Socorro page in GitHub
   <https://github.com/mozilla-services/socorro>`__.

3. (*Optional for Linux users*) Set UID and GID for Docker container user.

   If you're on Linux or you want to set the UID/GID of the app user that
   runs in the Docker containers, run:

   .. code-block:: shell

      $ just _env

   Then edit the file and set the ``USE_UID`` and ``USE_GID``
   variables. These will get used when creating the app user in the base
   image.

   If you ever want different values, change them in ``.env`` and re-run
   ``just build``.

4. Build Docker images for Socorro services.

   From the root of this repository, run:

   .. code-block:: shell

      $ just build

   That will build the app Docker image required for development.

5. Initialize services.

   To do that, run:

   .. code-block:: shell

      $ just setup

   This creates the Postgres database and sets up tables, stored procedures,
   integrity rules, types, and a bunch of other things. It also adds a bunch of
   static data to lookup tables.

   For Elasticsearch, it sets up Super Search fields and the index for
   processed crash data.

   For GCS, this creates the required buckets.

   For Pub/Sub, this creates the required topics and subscriptions.

6. Populate data stores with required lookup data.

   Then you need to fetch product build data and normalization data that
   Socorro relies on that comes from external systems and changes day-to-day.

   To do that, run:

   .. code-block:: shell

      $ just update-data


At this point, you should have a basic functional Socorro development
environment that has no crash data in it.

.. Note::

   You can run ``just setup`` and ``just update-data`` any time you want to
   throw out all state and re-initialize services.

.. Seealso::

   **Make changes to signature generation!**
       If you need to make changes to signature generation, see
       :ref:`signaturegeneration-chapter`.

   **Run the processor and get some crash data!**
       If you need crash data, see :ref:`processor-chapter` for additional
       setup, fetching crash data, and running the processor.

   **Update your local development environment!**
       See :ref:`gettingstarted-chapter-updating` for how to maintain and
       update your local development environment.

   **Learn about configuration!**
       See :ref:`gettingstarted-chapter-configuration` for how configuration
       works and about ``my.env``.

   **Run the webapp!**
       See :ref:`webapp-chapter` for additional setup and running the webapp.

   **Run scheduled tasks!**
       See :ref:`cron-chapter` for additional setup and running cronrun.


Bugs / Issues
=============

We use `Bugzilla <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/>`__ for bug tracking.

`Existing bugs <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=product%3Asocorro>`__

`Write up a new bug <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Socorro&component=General>`__

If you want to do work for which there is no bug, please write up a bug first
so we can work out the problem and how to approach a solution.


Code workflow
=============

Bugs
----

Either write up a bug or find a bug to work on.

Assign the bug to yourself.

Work out any questions about the problem, the approach to fix it, and any
additional details by posting comments in the bug.


Pull requests
-------------

Pull request summary should indicate the bug the pull request addresses. Use a
hyphen between "bug" and the bug ID(s) or "obs" and the OBS number.

Examples::

   bug-nnnnnnn: removed frog from tree class

   obs-nnn: removed from from tree class


For multiple bugs fixed within a single pull request, list the bugs out
individually.

Examples::

   bug-nnnnnnn, bug-nnnnnnn: removed frog from tree class

   obs-nnn, obs-nnn: removed from from tree class

   bug-nnnnnnn, obs-nnn: removed from from tree class


Pull request descriptions should cover at least some of the following:

1. what is the issue the pull request is addressing?
2. why does this pull request fix the issue?
3. how should a reviewer review the pull request?
4. what did you do to test the changes?
5. any steps-to-reproduce for the reviewer to use to test the changes

After creating a pull request, attach the pull request to the relevant bugs.

We use the
`rob-bugson Firefox addon <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/rob-bugson/>`__.
If the pull request has "bug-nnnnnnn: ..." or "bug-nnnnnnn, bug-nnnnnnn: ..."
in the summary, then rob-bugson will see that and create a "Attach this PR to
bug ..." link.

Then ask someone to review the pull request. If you don't know who to ask, look
at other pull requests to see who's currently reviewing things.


Code reviews
------------

Pull requests should be reviewed before merging.

Style nits should be covered by linting as much as possible.

Code reviews should review the changes in the context of the rest of the system.


Landing code
------------

Once the code has been reviewed and all tasks in CI pass, the pull request
author should merge the code.

This makes it easier for the author to coordinate landing the changes with
other things that need to happen like landing changes in another repository,
data migrations, configuration changes, and so on.

We use "Rebase and merge" in GitHub.


Conventions
===========

For conventions, see:
`<https://github.com/mozilla-services/socorro/blob/main/.editorconfig>`__


Python code conventions
-----------------------

All Python code files should have an MPL v2 header at the top::

   # This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public
   # License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this
   # file, You can obtain one at https://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.


To lint the code:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ just lint

If you hit issues with lines that fail linting, but you can't fix the issue,
use ``# noqa``.

To run the reformatter:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ just lint --fix

We're using:

* `ruff <https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/>`__: linting and code formatting


HTML conventions
----------------

2-space indentation.


Javascript code conventions
---------------------------

2-space indentation.

We're using:

* `eslint <https://eslint.org/>`__: linting


Git conventions
---------------

First line is a summary of the commit. It should start with the bug number. Use
a hyphen between "bug" and the bug ID(s) or "obs" and the OBS number.

Examples::

   bug-nnnnnnn: removed frog from tree class

   obs-nnn: removed from from tree class


For multiple bugs fixed within a single commit, list the bugs out individually.

Examples::

   bug-nnnnnnn, bug-nnnnnnn: removed frog from tree class

   obs-nnn, obs-nnn: removed from from tree class

   bug-nnnnnnn, obs-nnn: removed from from tree class


After that, the commit should explain *why* the changes are being made and any
notes that future readers should know for context.


Migrations
==========

Database migrations (Django)
----------------------------

We use Django's ORM and thus we do database migrations using Django's
migration system.

Do this:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ just shell
   app@socorro:/app$ cd webapp
   app@socorro:/app/webapp$ ./manage.py makemigration --name "BUGID_desc" APP


Elasticsearch migrations (Elasticsearch)
----------------------------------------

We don't do migrations of Elasticsearch data. The system creates a new index
every week, so any changes to new fields or mappings will be reflected the
next time it creates an index.


Dependencies
============

Python Dependencies
-------------------

Python dependencies for all parts of Socorro are in ``requirements.in``
and compiled using ``pip-compile`` with hashes and dependencies of dependencies
in the ``requirements.txt`` file.

For example, to add ``foobar`` version 5:

1. add ``foobar==5`` to ``requirements.in``
2. run:

   .. code-block:: shell

      $ just rebuild-reqs

   to apply the updates to ``requirements.txt``

3. rebuild your docker environment:

   .. code-block:: shell

      $ just build

If there are problems, it'll tell you.

In some cases, you might want to update the primary and all the secondary
dependencies. To do this, run:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ just rebuild-reqs --update


JavaScript Dependencies
-----------------------

Frontend dependencies for the webapp are in ``webapp/package.json``. They
must be pinned and included in
`package-lock.json <https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package-locks>`_.

You can add new dependencies using ``npm`` (you must use version 5 or higher):

.. code-block:: shell

   $ npm install --save-exact foobar@1.0.0

Then rebuild your docker environment:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ just build

If there are problems, it'll tell you.


Documentation
=============

Documentation for Socorro is build with `Sphinx
<http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/>`_ and is available on ReadTheDocs. API is
automatically extracted from docstrings in the code.

To build the docs, run this:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ just docs


Compiling the documentation will point out errors in reStructuredText.

Compiled documentation will be in ``docs/_build/html/index.html``. If you're on
Linux, you can do this to open the compiled documentation in your browser:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ xdg-open docs/_build/html/index.html

When you merge a PR into the main branch, that'll execute a webhook telling
`ReadTheDocs <https://readthedocs.org>`__ to rebuild the documentation. Then
you can videw it on `<https://socorro.readthedocs.io./>`__.


Testing
=======

Running tests
-------------

The Socorro tests are in ``socorro/tests/``.

The webapp tests are in ``webapp/``.

Both sets of tests use `pytest <https://pytest.org/>`__.

To run all of the tests, do:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ just test

That runs the ``/app/bin/test.sh`` script in the test container using test
configuration.

To run specific tests or specify arguments, you'll want to start a shell in the
test container:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ just test-shell

Then you can run pytest on the Socorro tests or the webapp tests.

Running the Socorro tests:

.. code-block:: shell

   app@socorro:/app$ pytest

Running the webapp tests (make sure you run ``./manage.py collectstatic`` first):

.. code-block:: shell

   app@socorro:/app$ cd webapp
   app@socorro:/app/webapp$ ./manage.py collectstatic
   app@socorro:/app/webapp$ pytest


.. Note::

   For the webapp tests, you have to run ``./manage.py collectstatic`` before
   running the tests.


.. Note::

   We have tests for code in Python, but we have **no** tests for code written
   in JavaScript. The frontend interface must be tested manually.


Writing tests
-------------

For Socorro tests, put them in ``socorro/tests/`` in a subdirectory parallel
to the thing you're testing.

For webapp tests, put them in the ``tests/`` directory of the appropriate app in
``webapp/`` directory tree.


Repository structure
====================

If you clone our `git repository <https://github.com/mozilla-services/socorro>`_,
you will find the following folders.

Here is what each of them contains:

**bin/**
    Scripts for building Docker images, running Docker containers, deploying,
    and supporting development in a local development environment.

**docker/**
    Docker environment related scripts, configuration, and other bits.

**docs/**
    Documentation of the Socorro project (you're reading it right now).

**socorro/**
    The bulk of the Socorro source code.

**webapp/**
    The webapp source code.


.. _gettingstarted-chapter-updating:

Updating data in a dev environment
==================================

Updating the code
-----------------

Any time you want to update the code in the repository, run something like this from
the main branch:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ git pull --prune


After you do that, you'll need to update other things.

If there were changes to the requirements files or setup scripts, you'll need to
build new images:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ just build


If there were changes to the database tables, stored procedures, types,
migrations, Super Search schema, or anything like that, you'll need to wipe
state and re-initialize services:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ just setup
   $ just update-data


Wiping crash storage and state
------------------------------

Any time you want to wipe all the crash storage destinations, remove all the
data, and reset the state of the system, run:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ just setup
   $ just update-data


Updating release data
---------------------

Release data and comes from running archivescraper. This is used by the
``BetaVersionRule`` in the processor.

Run:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ just update-data


.. _gettingstarted-chapter-configuration:

Configuration
=============

Configuration is pulled from three sources:

1. Envronment variables
2. ENV files located in ``/app/docker/config/``. See ``docker-compose.yml`` for
   which ENV files are used in which containers, and their precedence.
3. Defaults for the processor are in ``socorro/processor/processor_app.py``
   in ``CONFIG_DEFAULTS``.

   Defaults for the webapp are in ``webapp/crashstats/settings/``.

The sources above are ordered by precedence, i.e. configuration values defined
by environment variables will override values from ENV files or defaults.

The following ENV files can be found in ``/app/docker/config/``:

``local_dev.env``
    This holds *secrets* and *environment-specific configuration* required
    to get services to work in a Docker-based local development environment.

    This should **NOT** be used for server environments, but you could base
    configuration for a server environment on this file.

``test.env``
    This holds configuration specific to running the tests. It has some
    configuration value overrides because the tests are "interesting".

This ENV file is found in the repository root:

``.env``
    This file lets you override any environment variables set in other ENV files
    as well as set variables that are specific to your instance.

    It is your personal file for your specific development environment--it
    doesn't get checked into version control.

    The template for this is in ``docker/config/.env.dist``.

In this way:

1. environmental configuration which covers secrets, hosts, ports, and
   infrastructure-specific things can be set up for every environment

2. behavioral configuration which covers how the code behaves and which classes
   it uses is versioned alongside the code making it easy to deploy and revert
   behavioral changes with the code depending on them

3. ``.env`` lets you set configuration specific to your development environment
   as well as override any configuration and is not checked into version
   control


Setting configuration specific to your local dev environment
------------------------------------------------------------

There are some variables you need to set that are specific to your local dev
environment. Put them in ``.env``.


Overriding configuration
------------------------

If you want to override configuration temporarily for your local development
environment, put it in ``.env``.


Setting up a development container for VS Code
==============================================

The repository contains configuration files to build a
`development container <https://containers.dev/>`__ in the ``.devcontainer``
directory. If you have the "Dev Containers" extension installed in VS Code, you
should be prompted whether you want to reopen the folder in a container on
startup. You can also use the "Dev containers: Reopen in container" command
from the command palette. The container has all Python requirements installed.
IntelliSense, type checking, code formatting with Ruff and running the tests
from the test browser are all set up to work without further configuration.

VS Code should automatically start the container, but it may need to be built on
first run:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ just build devcontainer

Additionally on mac there is the potential that running git from inside any
container that mounts the current directory to ``/app``, such as the development
container, will fail with::

   fatal: detected dubious ownership in repository at '/app'

This is likely related to
`mozilla-services/tecken#2872 <https://github.com/mozilla-services/tecken/pull/2872>`_,
and can be treated by running the following command from inside the development
container, which will probably throw exceptions on some git read-only objects
that are already owned by app:app, so that's fine:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ chown -R app:app /app

If you change settings in ``my.env`` you may need to restart the container to
pick up changes:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ just run devcontainer


Upgrading to a new Python version
=================================

To upgrade Python to a new minor or major version, you need to change the version in
these files:

* ``.devcontainer/Dockerfile``
* ``.github/dependabot.yml``
* ``.readthedocs.yaml``
* ``docker/Dockerfile``
* ``pyproject.toml``
* ``socorro/tests/processor/test_processor_app.py``
* ``webapp/crashstats/crashstats/tests/test_sentry.py``


Processing crashes
==================

Running the processor is pretty uninteresting since it'll just sit there until
you give it something to process.

In order to process something, you first need to acquire raw crash data, put the
data in the S3 container in the appropriate place, then you need to add the
crash id to the standard queue.

We have helper scripts for these steps.

All helper scripts run in the shell in the container:

.. code-block::

   $ just shell

.. _`API token`:

Adding an API Token
-------------------

By default, the download scripts will fetch anonymized crash data, which does
not include personally identifiable information (PII). This anonymized data can
be used to test some workflows, but the the processor will not be able to
process minidumps and protected data won't be available in the webapp.

If you have protected data access in Crash Stats, you can create an API
token with these permissions:

* Reprocess Crashes
* View Personal Identifiable Information
* View Raw Dumps

You can generate API tokens at `<https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/api/tokens/>`_.

.. Note::

   Make sure you treat any data you pull from production in accordance with our
   data policies that you agreed to when granted access to it.

Add the API token value to your ``.env`` file::

   SOCORRO_API_TOKEN=apitokenhere

The API token is used by the scripts run inside ``just shell``, but not by
Socorro in the local dev environment.


bin/process_crashes.sh
----------------------

You can use the ``bin/process_crashes.sh`` script which will fetch crash data,
sync it with local dev environment storage, and publish the crash ids to the
queue for processing. If you have access to minidumps and use a valid
`API token`_, then memory dumps will be fetched for processing as well.

The ``bin/process_crashes.sh`` script takes one or more crash ids as arguments.

For example:

.. code-block:: shell

   app@socorro:/app$ bin/process_crashes.sh ed35821d-3af5-4fe9-bfa3-dc4dc0181128

You can also use it with ``fetch_crashids``:

.. code-block:: shell

   app@socorro:/app$ socorro-cmd fetch_crashids --num=1 | bin/process_crashes.sh

Run the processor and webapp with ``just run`` to process the crash reports.

If you find this doesn't meet your needs, you can write a shell script using
the commands and scripts that ``process_crashes.sh`` uses. They are described
below.


socorro-cmd fetch_crashids
--------------------------

This will generate a list of crash ids from Crash Stats that meet specified
criteria. Crash ids are printed to stdout, so you can use this in conjunction
with other scripts or redirect to a file.

This pulls 100 crash ids from yesterday for Firefox product:

.. code-block:: shell

   app@socorro:/app$ socorro-cmd fetch_crashids

This pulls 5 crash ids from 2017-09-01:

.. code-block:: shell

   app@socorro:/app$ socorro-cmd fetch_crashids --num=5 --date=2017-09-01

This pulls 100 crash ids for criteria specified with a Super Search url that we
copy and pasted:

.. code-block:: shell

   app@socorro:/app$ socorro-cmd fetch_crashids "--url=https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/search/?product=Firefox&date=%3E%3D2017-09-05T15%3A09%3A00.000Z&date=%3C2017-09-12T15%3A09%3A00.000Z&_sort=-date&_facets=signature&_columns=date&_columns=signature&_columns=product&_columns=version&_columns=build_id&_columns=platform"

You can get command help:

.. code-block:: shell

   app@socorro:/app$ socorro-cmd fetch_crashids --help


socorro-cmd fetch_crash_data
----------------------------

This will fetch raw crash data from Crash Stats and save it in the appropriate
directory structure rooted at outputdir. If you have access to memory dumps and
use a valid `API token`_, then minidumps will be fetched for processing as
well.

Usage from host:

.. code-block:: shell

   app@socorro:/app$ socorro-cmd fetch_crash_data <outputdir> <crashid> [<crashid> ...]


For example (assumes this crash exists):

.. code-block:: shell

   app@socorro:/app$ socorro-cmd fetch_crash_data ./testdata 5c9cecba-75dc-435f-b9d0-289a50170818


Use with ``fetch_crashids`` to fetch crash data from 100 crashes from yesterday
for Firefox:

.. code-block:: shell

   app@socorro:/app$ socorro-cmd fetch_crashids | socorro-cmd fetch_crash_data ./testdata


You can get command help:

.. code-block:: shell

   app@socorro:/app$ socorro-cmd fetch_crash_data --help


obs-common scripts
------------------

Additionally, there are scripts installed into the Socorro app Docker image
from the `obs-common <https://github.com/mozilla-services/obs-common>`__
project for manipulating data in storage.

See that project for details.


Example processing crash data in local dev environment
------------------------------------------------------

Let's process crashes for Firefox from yesterday.

First, build and initialize the local dev environment:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ just build
   $ just setup

   # Optionally, depending on what you're working on...
   $ just update-data


Then make sure you have ``SOCORRO_API_TOKEN`` set to your API token in your
``.env`` file.

In a terminal run Socorro:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ just run


Then in another terminal, generate a list of crash ids to process and queue
them up for processing:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ just shell
   app@socorro:/app$ socorro-cmd fetch_crashids --num=2 | ./bin/process_crashes.sh

   The crash(es) has/have been queued.
   To process and view them, start up the processor and webapp.


Then in the terminal where you're running Socorro, you'll see the processor
pick up the crash ids from the standard queue and process the crash reports.


Processing crashes from the collector
=====================================

.. Note::

   This needs to be updated--it's out-of-date.


`Antenna <https://antenna.readthedocs.io/>`_ is the collector of the Socorro
crash ingestion pipeline. It was originally part of the Socorro repository, but
we extracted and rewrote it and now it lives in its own repository and
infrastructure.

Antenna deployments are based on images pushed to Docker Hub.

To run Antenna in the Socorro local dev environment, do::

  $ docker compose up collector


It will listen on ``http://localhost:8888/`` for incoming crashes from a
breakpad crash reporter. It will save crash data to the ``dev-bucket`` in the
local S3 which is where the processor looks for it. It will publish the crash
ids to the standard queue.


Connect to PostgreSQL database
==============================

The local development environment's PostgreSQL database exposes itself on a
non-standard port when run with docker compose. You can connect to it with the
client of your choice using the following connection settings:

* Username: ``postgres``
* Password: ``postgres``
* Port: ``8574``
* Database: ``socorro``

For example::

    PGPASSWORD=postgres psql -h localhost -p 8574 -U postgres --no-password socorro

You can also connect with ``just``::

    just psql
