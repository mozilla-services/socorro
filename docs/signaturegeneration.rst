Signature Generation
====================

Introduction
------------

The :ref:`processor-chapter` creates an overall signature for a crash based on
the signatures of the stack frame of the crashing thread. It walks the
stack from the frame with the lowest number (the top of the stack)
applying rules and accumulating a list of signatures found to be
relevant. Once the rules are done, the list of signatures is
concatenated into a single string. That single string become the
crash's overall signature.      

Normalization
-------------

Before any frame signatures are considered, they are normalized. This
is just a string formating change. Runs of spaces are compressed to
just one space. Commas are insured to always be followed by a space,
integer values are replaced by 'int'. Signatures that match the
signaturesWithLineNumbersRegEx regular expression are combined with
their source code line. Frames that have no function information are
written as sourcecode/line number pairs. If no source code is
available, it tries to find a module/address pair. Failing that, it
falls back to just an address.          

The SkipList Rules
------------------

The signature is generated by walking through each stack frame
considering its 'name' (as normalized above). Frames / names are
skipped or added to the signature list according to the rules. When a
signature list is complete, it is converted to string by concatenating
the frame names with spaces and a vertical bar between each name, for
example: objc_msgSend | IdleTimerVector is the signature for a stack
that contained (irrelevant frames), "objc_msgSend", "IdleTimerVector"
which matched neither prefix nor irrelevant regular expressions and
possibly other frames which did not become part of the signature.
  
regular expressions
-------------------

Each SkipList rule is a regular expression. Typically, it takes the
form of an alternation of frame names, but any legal regular
expression can be used. Regular expression alternation syntax is
a|b|c: Match on 'a' or 'b' or 'c'. This work is done in Python, so use
Python Regular Expression Syntax       

signatureSentinels
------------------

A typical rule might be: "_purecall".

This is the first rule to be applied. The code iterates through the
stack frame, throwing away everything it finds until it encounters a
match to this regular expression or the end of the stack. If it finds
a match, it passes all the frames after the match to the next step. If
it finds no match, it passes the whole list of frames to the next
step.       

irrelevantSignatureRegEx
------------------------

A typical rule might be:
"@0x0-9a-fA-F{2,}|@0x1-9a-fA-F|RaiseException|CxxThrowException". 

A frame which matches this regular expression will be appended to the
signature only if a prefix frame has already been seen (see next
rule).     

prefixSignatureRegEx
--------------------

A typical rule might be
"@0x0|strchr|strstr|strlen|PL_strlen|strcmp|wcslen|memcpy|memmove|memcmp|malloc|realloc|objc_msgSend",
though at Mozilla it has grown much longer.    

This is the rule that generates compound signatures. A frame that
matches this regular expression changes the state of the machine to
'seen prefix'. In 'seen prefix' state, irrelevant or prefix frames are
appended. As soon as a frame is neither, it is appended and the
signature list is complete.       

Once the signature list is complete, the signature is generated as
mentioned above
